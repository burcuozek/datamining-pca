# Data Mining - Application of PCA 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is a dimensionality-reduction method that is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

In this project, PCA method is applied using R. The following steps are used to reduce the dimension of data:
- Standardization
- Covariance matrix computation
- Computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components
- Computation of feature vector

The following dataset is used: 
- US Judge Ratings Data Set (https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/r-dataset-package-datasets-usjudgeratings)
- Glass Identification Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification)
- Physical Measurements on Children Between Ages Seven and Seventeen (Harman 23 Data Set) (https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/Harman23.cor.html)
- Psychological Tests Given to Seventh and Eight-grade Children (Harman 75 Data Set) (https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/Harman74.cor.html)
- Vertebral Data Set - Biomedical (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral+column)
