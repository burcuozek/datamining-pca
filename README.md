# datamining-pca

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is a dimensionality-reduction method that is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

In this project, PCA method is applied using R. The following steps are used to reduce the dimension of data:
- Standardization
- Covariance matrix computation
- Computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components
- Computation of feature vector
